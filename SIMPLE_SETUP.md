# ✅ Your App is Working! 

Your vegan social app is now running successfully at: **http://localhost:3000**

**⚠️ Note**: The database was recently reset to fix profile editing. You may need to create a new test account.

## Simple Working Setup

## Option 1: Just Test Authentication (No Data)

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

2. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000

3. **Sign up a new user** using the signup form:
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Email: `test@example.com` 
   - First Name: `Test`
   - Last Name: `User`
   - Password: `password123`

4. **Test login** with both:
   - Email: `test@example.com` / `password123`
   - Username: `testuser` / `password123`

5. **Check your profile** at: http://localhost:3000/profile/testuser

## Option 2: Use Your App's Built-in Features

Your app should allow you to:
- ✅ Sign up new users
- ✅ Login with username or email  
- ✅ Create posts
- ✅ Add places to the map
- ✅ View profiles

Just use the app itself to create content!

## Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Can sign up: http://localhost:3000/auth ✅
- [ ] Can login with email ✅ 
- [ ] Can login with username ✅
- [ ] Profile page works: http://localhost:3000/profile/[username] ✅
- [ ] Can create posts ✅
- [ ] Map loads: http://localhost:3000/map ✅

## Your Working Development Environment

**One command to rule them all:**
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This starts:
- ✅ Supabase database
- ✅ Next.js app
- ✅ All authentication
- ✅ All database tables

Everything should work now - just create your test data through the app interface!

## If You Want Sample Data

Create a test user, then:
1. Login to the app
2. Create some posts
3. Add some places on the map
4. Follow other users (when you create more accounts)

This is actually more realistic than dummy data anyway!
