# VeganConnect Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed

This update addresses the following issues:

1. ‚úÖ **Authentication loading stuck on page refresh** - Fixed with simplified auth context
2. ‚úÖ **Settings page not saving to database** - Fixed with proper error handling and logging
3. ‚úÖ **Avatar upload cropping issues** - Completely removed cropping, now direct upload
4. ‚úÖ **Database schema issues** - Added proper avatar_url column and storage setup

## Quick Setup

### 1. Database Schema Fix

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Ensure users table has avatar_url column
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users' AND column_name = 'avatar_url') THEN
    ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Added avatar_url column to users table';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Create avatars storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Set up storage policies for avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Public can view avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatars" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```

### 2. Restart Development Server

After making the database changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What's New

### Simplified Avatar Upload
- **No more cropping UI** - Direct upload on file selection
- **2MB file size limit** - Automatic validation
- **Immediate upload** - Files upload as soon as selected
- **Database integration** - Avatar URLs saved to user profile

### Robust Authentication
- **Simplified auth context** - Removed complex caching logic
- **Better error handling** - Clear console logging for debugging
- **Reliable initialization** - No more stuck loading states

### Settings Page Improvements
- **Enhanced logging** - See exactly what's being saved
- **Better error messages** - Specific error details shown
- **Reliable saving** - Database updates work consistently

## Testing

1. **Page Refresh Test**: Navigate to feed/map, refresh page - should load without getting stuck
2. **Settings Test**: Update profile data, click Save - should see success message
3. **Avatar Test**: Click avatar circle, select image - should upload immediately without cropping

## Debugging

If issues persist, check browser console for:
- `üîÑ` Auth initialization logs
- `üìù` Profile update logs
- `‚úÖ` Success confirmations
- `‚ùå` Error details

All major operations now have comprehensive logging for easier debugging.
