# üß† Intelligent Feed Algorithm

## Overview

PlantsPack uses an advanced AI-powered algorithm to personalize your feed experience, ensuring you see the most relevant and engaging content from the vegan community. Our algorithm learns from your interactions to continuously improve your feed quality while maintaining diversity and preventing echo chambers.

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Multi-Factor Scoring System

Every post receives a relevancy score based on four key factors:

#### **Interest Match (40% weight)**
- **Content Tags**: How well the post's topics align with your interests (recipes, restaurants, activism, health, etc.)
- **Content Type Preference**: Your engagement history with different types of content (recipes, reviews, lifestyle, etc.)
- **Author Affinity**: How much you typically engage with posts from specific authors

#### **Social Signals (25% weight)**
- **Network Engagement**: How many people in your network (followers/following) have liked or commented on the post
- **Friend Activity**: Posts that your connections find interesting get a boost in your feed
- **Community Trends**: Content that's generating healthy discussions across the platform

#### **Recency Boost (20% weight)**
- **Time Decay**: Newer content gets higher priority, with engagement scores decreasing over time
- **Fresh Content**: Recently posted content receives a temporary boost to ensure visibility
- **24-Hour Window**: Posts get maximum recency boost in their first 24 hours

#### **Quality Score (15% weight)**
- **Engagement Rate**: Ratio of likes and comments to views
- **Content Completeness**: Posts with images, proper length, and tags score higher
- **Interaction Quality**: Comments and meaningful engagement weighted higher than simple likes

### 2. Bonus Factors

#### **Location Relevance (10% bonus)**
- **Local Content**: Posts from your city or region get priority if you've enabled location sharing
- **Regional Interests**: Content from areas you've shown interest in
- **Location-Based Communities**: Local vegan events, restaurants, and meetups

#### **Diversity Factor (5% bonus)**
- **Echo Chamber Prevention**: Algorithm introduces 20% diverse content to expand your horizons
- **Topic Variety**: Ensures you see different types of content even if you typically engage with one category
- **Discovery Mode**: Introduces you to new creators and topics based on your openness to discovery

## üîÑ Learning & Adaptation

### User Interaction Tracking
The algorithm learns from your behavior:

- **Likes**: +0.8 relevancy boost for similar content
- **Comments**: +1.0 relevancy boost (shows deeper engagement)
- **Shares**: +1.2 relevancy boost (highest engagement indicator)
- **Views**: +0.1 relevancy boost (passive engagement)
- **Time Spent**: Longer reading time increases similar content visibility

### Pattern Recognition
- **Content Type Preferences**: Learns whether you prefer recipes, restaurant reviews, or lifestyle content
- **Tag Affinity**: Identifies which topics you engage with most (health, environment, cooking, etc.)
- **Author Relationships**: Recognizes which creators you consistently interact with
- **Optimal Timing**: Learns when you're most active and adjusts content delivery
