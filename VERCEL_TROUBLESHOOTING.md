# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## 🚨 **Issue: Deployments Not Starting Automatically**

I've fixed the most likely cause - the `ignoreCommand` in `vercel.json` was too aggressive and might have been skipping builds when it shouldn't.

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Removed `ignoreCommand`** from `vercel.json` 
   - This was preventing automatic deployments
   - Now all pushes will trigger deployments

2. **Simplified `vercel.json`** configuration
   - Removed potentially problematic cron job reference
   - Kept only essential configuration

3. **Updated ignore script** (if you want to re-enable it later)
   - Made logic more conservative
   - Only skips pure documentation changes

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

### **1. Check Vercel Dashboard**
- Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Select your project
- Check if deployments are appearing in the "Deployments" tab

### **2. Verify Git Integration**
- In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Git
- Ensure your GitHub repo is properly connected
- Check that the branch is set correctly (usually `main`)

### **3. Check Environment Variables**
Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables and verify:

```bash
# Required variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (or sk_test_...)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... (or pk_test_...)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### **4. Test Manual Deployment**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you haven't
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy manually to test
vercel --prod
```

### **5. Check Build Logs**
- In Vercel dashboard → Deployments → Click on a deployment
- Check the "Build Logs" tab for errors
- Look for any failed steps

## 🛠️ **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue: "Build Command Failed"**
```bash
# Check if build works locally:
npm run build

# Common fixes:
npm ci                    # Clean install dependencies
rm -rf .next node_modules # Clear cache
npm install              # Reinstall
npm run build           # Test build
```

### **Issue: "Environment Variables Missing"**
- Double-check all required env vars in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure they're set for the correct environment (Production/Preview)
- Verify no extra spaces or quotes

### **Issue: "Git Integration Not Working"**
- Disconnect and reconnect GitHub integration in Vercel
- Check repository permissions
- Ensure Vercel app is installed on your GitHub account/org

### **Issue: "Function Timeout"**
- Check if your API routes are hanging
- Verify database connections are working
- Check Stripe webhook endpoints

## 📋 **Current Vercel Configuration**

Your `vercel.json` is now simplified and should work:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev", 
  "installCommand": "npm ci",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "functions": {
    "src/app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "env": {
    // Environment variables
  },
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "@next_public_supabase_url",
      "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "@next_public_supabase_anon_key",
      "PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 **Test Deployment**

Try pushing a small change to trigger a deployment:

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 📞 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check Vercel Status**: [status.vercel.com](https://status.vercel.com)
2. **Contact Vercel Support**: If everything looks correct
3. **Try Different Branch**: Create a new branch and test deployment
4. **Re-import Project**: Delete and re-import project in Vercel

## 🎯 **Quick Fix Summary**

✅ Removed `ignoreCommand` from `vercel.json`  
✅ Simplified configuration  
✅ All pushes should now trigger deployments  
✅ Build process is straightforward: `npm ci` → `npm run build`  

Your deployments should work now! Push a change and check your Vercel dashboard.
